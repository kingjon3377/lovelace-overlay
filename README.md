The `lovelace` overlay is the personal overlay of [Jonathan
Lovelace](https://www.google.com/profiles/kingjon3377).

Many, if not most, of the packages here are ones I had installed in a Debian or
Ubuntu chroot (when I still had the disk space to spare to maintain one)
because they looked interesting; when I removed those chroots, I found ebuilds
for what packages I could (in [Gentoo Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org), in
others' overlays, and in a couple of cases distributed by the upstream
developers), and created ebuilds for those that I couldn't find elsewhere yet
weren't too tricky.

A few of the ebuilds are taken from [the Gentoo
Attic](https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/), having been
removed from the main tree, or from the main tree when ebuilds were masked for
removal. An ebuild or two is copied from the main tree (as a revision bump),
and kept in sync with the main-tree version as best I can, with some slight
modifications.
