<longdescription>PolyGen is a program for generating random sentences according
  to a grammar definition, that is following custom syntactical and lexical
  rules.

  Formally, it is an interpreter of a language itself designed to define
  languages, where to interpret means executing a source program in real time
  and eventually outputting its result.

  Here a source program is a grammar definition, the execution consists in the
  exploration of such grammar by selecting a random path and the result is the
  sentence built on the way.

  Though PolyGen is quite a serious piece of software then, what else would be
  more noble for it than being used as a parody tool for linguistical habits,
  stereotypes and trends of this foolish era?

  Principles of parody are focusing a ridiculous topic and eventually
  abstracting its rules and schemes (here in terms of a grammar definition) by
  which reproducing it through the variatio device.  And randomization is
  perfect at this purpose thanks to its purely asemantic behaviour
