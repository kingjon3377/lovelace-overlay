 <longdescription>This script fetches Wikipedia articles (currently supports
   around 30 Wikipedia languages) and displays them as plain text in a pager or
   just sends the text to standard out. Alternatively it opens the Wikipedia
   article in a (possibly GUI) web browser or just shows the URL of the
   appropriate Wikipedia article.</longdescription>
