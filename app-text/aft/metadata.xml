 <longdescription>AFT is a document preparation system. It is mostly free form
   meaning that there is little intrusive markup. AFT source documents look a
   lot like plain old ASCII text.

   AFT has a few rules for structuring your document and these rules have more
   to do with formatting your text rather than embedding commands.

   Right now, AFT produces pretty good (weblint-able) HTML, XHTML, LaTeX, lout
   and RTF. It can, in fact, be coerced into producing all types of output
   (e.g.  roll-your-own XML). All that needs to be done is to edit a rule file.
   You can even customize your own HTML rule files for specialized
   output.</longdescription>
