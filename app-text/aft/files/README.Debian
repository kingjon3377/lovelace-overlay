AFT for Debian
--------------

/usr/share/doc/aft/vim contains a vim syntax highlighting script and notes on 
how to use it by David Bourgeois. I will try to get this into the vim package 
at some point in the future, but for now you will have to install them 
yourself.

The same goes for the file in the jed directory, which is an AFT mode for the
popular jed editor, by Guido Gonzato.
