# Changes the UI in a way I don't like
=app-text/fbreader-0.99.5

# Doesn't yet build, more effort is needed to see what patches are still needed
# or will apply, and probably we'll need to download the 'brt' source tarball
# too.
=dev-lang/sdlbasic-2012.12.15

# Bundles Tk, dev-tcltk/tix, and probably TCL in their entirety. Mask until

# autotools), is fixed.

# Not complete due to missing deps (org.eclipse.jetty, which is *not* www-servers/jetty!)
