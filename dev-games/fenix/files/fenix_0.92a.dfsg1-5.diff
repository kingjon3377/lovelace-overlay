+Especificación del formato FPL (Fenix Palette)
+
+Esta sección describe el contenido de un fichero FPL. No es necesario conocer
+estos detalles simplemente para programar juegos, pero serán de utilidad a
+quien quiera realizar utilidades en lenguajes externos que lean o escriban
+ficheros FPL.
+
+Un fichero FPL no incluye compresión. Fenix soporta de forma transparente el
+uso de compresión GZIP en los ficheros, sin necesidad de marcarlos
+especialmente con extensión .gz. Normalmente un fichero FPL se guarda en disco
+comprimido de esta manera, pero en el resto del fichero asumiremos que el
+fichero FPL no está comprimido.
+
+En la descripción siguiente, DWORD identifica un número entero de 4 bytes sin
+signo mientras INT indica entero de 4 bytes con signo. Estos valores se guardan
+siguiendo la codificación Intel de bytes en memoria, así que hay que darles
+la vuelta al leer o escribir el fichero en otras plataformas.

+GNU Free Documentation License
+
+Version 1.2, November 2002
+
+  Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
+  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+0. PREAMBLE
+
+The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
+
+This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
+
+We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
+
+1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
+
+This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
+
+A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
+
+A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
+
+The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
+
+The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
+
+A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
+
+Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
+
+The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
+
+A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
+
+The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
+
+2. VERBATIM COPYING
+
+You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
+
+You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
+
+3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
+
+If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
+
+If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
+
+If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
+
+It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
+
+4. MODIFICATIONS
+
+You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
+
+    * A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
+    * B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
+    * C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
+    * D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
+    * E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
+    * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
+    * G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
+    * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
+    * I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
+    * J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
+    * K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
+    * L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
+    * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
+    * N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
+    * O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
+
+If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
+
+You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
+
+You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
+
+The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
+
+5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
+
+You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
+
+The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
+
+In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."
+
+6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
+
+You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
+
+You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
+
+7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
+
+A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
+
+If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
+
+8. TRANSLATION
+
+Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
+
+If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
+
+9. TERMINATION
+
+You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
+
+The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
+
+Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
+How to use this License for your documents
+
+To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:
+
+  Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
+  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
+  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
+  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
+  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
+  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
+  Free Documentation License".
+
+If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
+
+  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
+  Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
+
+If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
+
+If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

+Cada gráfico dentro del fichero FGC se guarda en formato FBM , a partir del
+offset indicado en la cabecera. Sin embargo, el formato FBM utilizado tiene dos
+variantes respecto al formato FBM estándar descrito aquí:
+
+    * No contiene cabecera. El gráfico empieza directamente con el descriptor
+      FBM justo en el offset indicado en la cabecera del FGC. La profundidad de
+      color se recoge también de la cabecera del FGC, ya que no está presente
+      en dicho descriptor.
+
+    * No contiene paleta de colores, incluso aunque sea un gráfico de 8 bits.
+      Todos los gráficos dentro del FGC comparten la misma paleta de colores,
+      guardada en el FGC justo antes que los datos de los gráficos.
+
+NOTAS
+
+Esta es una versión temporal de este formato de fichero. Los gráficos con
+profundidad de color de 24 bits se soportarán próximamente en los ficheros
+FBM. Esta es una versión temporal de este formato de fichero. Es posible que
+en versiones posteriores se soporten paletas indexadas con mayor resolucion de
+color con intencion de reducir el tamaño necesario para almacenar gráficos en
+formatos de alta densidad de color (16, 24 y 32 bpp) .

+Especificación del formato FPG
+
+Esta sección describe el contenido de un fichero FPG. No es necesario conocer
+estos detalles simplemente para programar juegos, pero serán de utilidad a
+quien quiera realizar utilidades en lenguajes externos que lean o escriban
+ficheros FPG.
+
+Un fichero FPG no incluye compresión. Fenix soporta de forma transparente el
+uso de compresión GZIP en los ficheros, sin necesidad de marcarlos
+especialmente con extensión .gz. Normalmente un fichero FPG se guarda en disco
+comprimido de esta manera, pero en el resto del fichero asumiremos que el
+fichero FPG no está comprimido.
+
+Cabecera
+
+Un fichero FPG comienza con la siguiente cabecera:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre____________|Tamaño_|Descripción______________________________________|
+|                  |       |Cadena de caracteres de identificación del       |
+|                  |       |fichero. Debe contener exactamente "fpg" o "f16",|
+|MAGIC             |3 bytes|en minusculas. Dependiendo de estos valores lo   |
+|                  |       |que sigue en el fichero se referirá a un archivo |
+|__________________|_______|FPG_de_8_bits_(fpg)_o_de_16_bits_(f16).__________|
+|                  |       |A continuación, los cuatro bytes 1Ah, 0Dh, 0Ah y |
+|                  |       |00h. Esta terminación indica, en un fichero MS-  |
+|TERMINACIÓN MS-DOS|4 bytes|DOS, final de fichero. Gracias a ella un comando |
+|                  |       |TYPE en MS-DOS no mostraría los datos binarios   |
+|__________________|_______|del_fichero._____________________________________|
+|                  |       |Código de versión. Debido a que no se han        |
+|VERSION           |1 byte |introducido cambios en el formato, este valor es |
+|__________________|_______|siempre_00h._____________________________________|
+
+Paleta de colores
+
+A continuación, si el gráfico es de 8 bits (tal como indica la cabecera del
+fichero) y sólo en ese caso, aparecen 768 bytes con la paleta de colores. Cada
+color ocupa tres bytes en orden RGB (rojo, verde y azul) y con un rango para
+cada componente de color de 0 a 63. Seguido aparecerán 576 bytes con
+información de las gamas, que podran ser ignorados en Fenix. Para mas
+información sobre este punto y sobre el formato PAL en general, consulta la
+especificación del formato PAL.
+
+Mapas
+
+Seguidamente se almacenan los mapas, sin orden necesario. Tan solo habrá que
+leer los datos hasta que se produzca el EOF (end of file - final de fichero).
+Será solo en ese caso cuando estemos seguros de que no existen más mapas
+almacenados en el fichero. No cabe duda decir que esto imposibilita la
+adicción de nueva informacion adicional.
+
+Todos los bloques de datos que representan a un mapa siguen la misma
+estructura. Esto es, un descriptor con información acerca del mismo y,
+seguidamente, los datos propios del mapa.
+
+Como acabamos de decir:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________

+
+Puntos de control
+
+En este apartado se almacenan los puntos de control, tantos como indique el

+si ese valor es cero. En todo caso, cada punto de control es una estructura de
+4 bytes que contiene:

+|X_____|2_bytes|Coordenada_X_del_punto_de_control.___________________________|
+|Y_____|2_bytes|Coordenada_Y_del_punto_de_control.___________________________|
+
+Imaginemos que tenemos configurado solo el punto de control 54, por ejemplo.
+Aun así en el fichero se veran representados todos los puntos de control hasta
+ese. En este caso los puntos que no hemos configurado tendran un valor de -
+1 tanto en la coordenada X como en la Y.
+
+Ejemplo:
+
+      Solo hemos configurado el punto 4. Por lo tanto tendremos esto:
+            Punto 000 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 001: X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 002 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 003 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 004 : X = 200; Y = 125
+
+      Ahora hemos configurado el punto 2 y el 4. Por lo tanto tendremos esto:
+            Punto 000 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 001 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 002 : X = 64; Y = 32
+            Punto 003 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 004 : X = 200; Y = 125
+
+NOTA : Con la inclusión de la posibilidad de usar puntos de control con
+coordenadas negativas, no estoy seguro de que esto siga vigente (lo de usar el
+-1 para puntos de control nulos).

+Paleta de colores
+
+A continuación, si el gráfico es de 8 bits (tal como indica la cabecera del
+fichero) y sólo en ese caso, aparecen 768 bytes con la paleta de colores. Cada
+color ocupa tres bytes en orden RGB (rojo, verde y azul) y con un rango para
+cada componente de color de 0 a 255.
+
+Secuencias
+
+A continuación, inmediatamente después de la paleta, si corresponde, o del
+descriptor en formatos no paletizados, se guardan las secuencias de animación
+del FBM. Puede haber más de una, pero siempre habrá al menos una. El valor
+"MAX SEQUENCE" del descriptor indica el número total de secuencias presentes
+en el fichero, menos una.
+
+Cada secuencia de animación ocupa 44 bytes en el fichero, y su estructura es

+|ÚLTIMO KEYFRAME    |DWORD   |Además, dos secuencias de animación no pueden  |

+Keyframes
+
+Un keyframe es uno de los "momentos" de los que se compone una animación.
+Contiene un número de frame y opciones adicionales que pueden emplearse para
+automatizar tareas comunes enlazadas con la animación, como asignar un ángulo
+o flags al proceso.
+
+Cada keyframe ocupa 16 bytes en el fichero y contiene la siguiente
+información:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre|Tamaño|Descripción___________________________________________________|
+|FRAME_|DWORD__|Índice_de_frame_del_gráfico_FBM_que_debe_mostrarse.__________|
+|      |       |Ángulo con el cual se mostrará el gráfico. Este ángulo se    |

+|FLAGS |DWORD  |espejo horizontal un gráfico en cuya animación aparezca un   |
+|      |       |keyframe invertido horizontalmente, se verá correctamente    |

+|      |       |milisegundos que deben transcurrir hasta que la animación    |
+|______|_______|termine._____________________________________________________|
+
+Puntos de control
+
+A continuación en el fichero se almacenan los puntos de control, tantos como
+indique el valor PUNTOS en el descriptor. Es posible que esta sección no esté
+presente si ese valor es cero. En todo caso, cada punto de control es una
+estructura de 12 bytes que contiene:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre_|Tamaño|Descripción__________________________________________________|
+|       |       |Índice del punto de control, de 0 a 999. El 0 indica centro |
+|ÍNDICE |DWORD  |del gráfico, y si no lo incluye, se considerará su centro   |
+|_______|_______|geométrico_para_tal_fin.____________________________________|
+|       |       |Coordenada X del punto de control. Puede ser negativa o más |
+|X      |INT    |grande que el gráfico, pero actualmente el rango soportado  |

+|Y______|INT____|Coordenada_Y,_con_las_mismas_condiciones_que_X._____________|
+
+Datos del gráfico
+
+Por último, aparecen los datos del gráfico propiamente dichos, de arriba a
+abajo. En primer lugar se guardan todas las filas del primer frame, a
+continuación todas las filas del segundo, y así hasta almacenar todos los
+frames del gráfico, hasta el número de índice indicado en el descriptor.
+
+En un gráfico de 1 bit por pixel, cada fila incluye padding (bits a 0) hasta
+ocupar un ancho múltiplo de un byte.
+
+En un gráfico de 8 bits el valor 0 está reservado para los pixels
+transparentes.
+
+En un gráfico de 16 bits, cada pixel se guarda en formato RGB565 con el valor
+0 reservado para los pixels transparentes (lo cual significa que el color negro
+puro no puede usarse, siendo necesario sustituirlo por un valor aproximado).
+
+En todo caso, cualquier información adicional que aparezca en el fichero
+después de los datos del gráfico es ignorada. Esto permite realizar
+extensiones futuras del formato sin perder la compatibilidad hacia atrás.
+
+NOTAS
+
+Esta es una versión temporal de este formato de fichero. Los gráficos con
+profundidad de color de 24 bits se soportarán próximamente en los ficheros
+FBM.

+
+Paleta de colores
+
+A continuación aparecen 768 bytes con la paleta de colores. Cada color ocupa
+tres bytes en orden RGB (rojo, verde y azul) y con un rango para cada
+componente de color de 0 a 63. Seguido aparecerán 576 bytes con información
+de las gamas, que podran ser ignorados en Fenix. Para mas información sobre
+este punto y sobre el formato PAL en general, consulta la especificación del
+formato PAL.
+
+Flags
+
+A continuación, inmediatamente después de la paleta, se guardan 4 que, aun

+
+A continuación, aparecen 768 bytes con la paleta de colores. Cada color ocupa
+tres bytes en orden RGB (rojo, verde y azul) y con un rango para cada
+componente de color de 0 a 63. Tambien puede verse como un array de estructuras
+RGB, o lo que es lo mismo, 256 veces lo siguiente:

+|BLUE_(Azul)__|1_byte_|Valor_de_la_componente_azul_de_este_color_(de_0_a_63)_|
+
+El hecho de que el valor de cada componente oscile entre 0 y 63, en vez de 0 a
+255, es un poco inusual. Podemos convertir cada valor facilmente a RGB estándar
+con la siguiente operación:
+
+red256 = red64 * 255 / 63
+green256 = green64 * 255 / 63
+blue256 = blue64 * 255 / 63
+
+Esto conlleva una pérdida de color, o mejor dicho, que no se puedan usar todos
+los colores.
+
+Gammas de Color
+
+Este apartado está poco documentado. Originalmente las gammas solo eran utiles
+en el editor de mapas de DIV / DIV2. En Fenix son totalmente ignoradas, con lo
+que la lectura del fichero termina con la lectura de la paleta. Usualmente
+estos datos ocuparán 576 bytes.
+
+De todas formas, por si a alguien le puede interesar, a continuación se
+especifica la estructura de los datos correspondientes a las gammas. Realmente
+se trata de un array o colección de 16 elementos de estructuras de tipo gamma.
+Cada una de estas estructuras sigue el siguiente patrón:

+    * Modo = 0
+    * Fija = 0
+    * Colores[16] = los colores correspondientes en la paleta, dependiendo de

+      colores del 0 al 15; en la segunda, del 16 al 31; etc...
+
+NOTA: Dado que las gammas solo son útiles en el editor de mapas de DIV / DIV2,
+se recomienda el uso del mismo para una mejor comprensión de este apartado.

+Especificación del formato MAP
+
+Esta sección describe el contenido de un fichero MAP. No es necesario conocer
+estos detalles simplemente para programar juegos, pero serán de utilidad a
+quien quiera realizar utilidades en lenguajes externos que lean o escriban
+ficheros MAP.
+
+Un fichero MAP no incluye compresión. Fenix soporta de forma transparente el
+uso de compresión GZIP en los ficheros, sin necesidad de marcarlos
+especialmente con extensión .gz. Normalmente un fichero MAP se guarda en disco
+comprimido de esta manera, pero en el resto del fichero asumiremos que el
+fichero MAP no está comprimido.
+
+Cabecera
+
+Un fichero MAP comienza con la siguiente cabecera:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre____________|Tamaño_|Descripción______________________________________|
+|                  |       |Cadena de caracteres de identificación del       |
+|                  |       |fichero. Debe contener exactamente "map" o "m16",|
+|MAGIC             |3 bytes|en minusculas. Dependiendo de estos valores lo   |
+|                  |       |que sigue en el fichero se referirá a un archivo |
+|__________________|_______|MAP_de_8_bits_(map)_o_de_16_bits_(m16).__________|
+|                  |       |A continuación, los cuatro bytes 1Ah, 0Dh, 0Ah y |
+|                  |       |00h. Esta terminación indica, en un fichero MS-  |
+|TERMINACIÓN MS-DOS|4 bytes|DOS, final de fichero. Gracias a ella un comando |
+|                  |       |TYPE en MS-DOS no mostraría los datos binarios   |
+|__________________|_______|del_fichero._____________________________________|
+|                  |       |Código de versión. Debido a que no se han        |
+|VERSION           |1 byte |introducido cambios en el formato, este valor es |
+|__________________|_______|siempre_00h._____________________________________|
+
+Descriptor
+
+Inmediatamente después de la cabecera aparece un bloque descriptor de 40 bytes
+de contenido fijo. Se puede interpretar como una extensión de la cabecera:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre______|Tamaño__|Descripción___________________________________________|
+|            |        |Ancho en pixels del gráfico. A partir de este ancho se|
+|            |        |puede calcular la cantidad de memoria en bytes que    |
+|            |        |ocupa una fila del gráfico en disco, y que depende de |
+|ANCHO       |2 bytes |la PROFUNDIDAD de la cabecera:                        |
+|            |        |    * Profundidad 8: ancho                            |
+|            |        |    * Profundiad 16: ancho * 2                        |
+|            |        |NOTA : El tamaño en bytes de este dato difiere del    |
+|____________|________|que_podemos_encontrar_en_un_fichero_FPG.______________|
+|            |        |Alto en pixels del pixels del gráfico.                |
+|ALTO        |2 bytes |NOTA : El tamaño en bytes de este dato difiere del    |
+|____________|________|que_podemos_encontrar_en_un_fichero_FPG.______________|
+|            |        |Identificador del gráfico, de 0 a 999. Cuando el      |
+|            |        |gráfico forma parte de una librería FPG, indica su    |
+|            |        |número de índice. El hecho de que se guarde en el     |
+|ID          |4 bytes |fichero MAP permite extraer un gráfico del fichero    |
+|            |        |FPG, grabarlo como MAP, y que ocupe la misma posición |
+|            |        |si se importa de nuevo o se copia en otro FPG         |
+|____________|________|diferente.____________________________________________|
+|            |        |Cadena de texto de 32 bytes que se corresponde con una|
+|            |        |breve descripción del contenido del gráfico. Debe     |
+|DESCRIPCIÓN |32 bytes|ocupar exactamente 32 bytes, con lo cual si la        |
+|            |        |descripción es menor en tamaño, la cadena deberá ser  |
+|____________|________|rellenada_con_el_código_ASCII_0.______________________|
+
+Paleta de colores
+
+A continuación, si el gráfico es de 8 bits (tal como indica la cabecera del
+fichero) y sólo en ese caso, aparecen 768 bytes con la paleta de colores. Cada
+color ocupa tres bytes en orden RGB (rojo, verde y azul) y con un rango para
+cada componente de color de 0 a 63. Seguido aparecerán 576 bytes con
+información de las gamas, que podran ser ignorados en Fenix. Para mas
+información sobre este punto y sobre el formato PAL en general, consulta la
+especificación del formato PAL.
+
+Flags
+
+A continuación, inmediatamente después de la paleta, si corresponde, o del
+descriptor en formatos no paletizados, se guardan 2 bytes con información
+adicional acerca de este mapa en concreto.
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre|Tamaño_|Descripción__________________________________________________|
+|      |       |Actualmente, en este dato se almacena información acerca del |
+|      |       |numero de puntos de control y de la animación. Para saber    |
+|      |       |estos dos valores solo deberemos someter dicho dato a un AND.|
+|      |       |Las constantes son:                                          |
+|      |       |    * F_NCPOINTS = 0x0FFF                                    |
+|FLAGS |2 bytes|    * F_ANIMATION = 0x1000                                   |
+|      |       |Por ejemplo, para hayar el numero de puntos de control basta |
+|      |       |con hacer: n_cpoints = flags AND F_NCPOINTS                  |
+|      |       |NOTA� : La animación en el formato MAP está en desuso y poco |
+|      |       |documentada, por lo que se desaconseja su uso.               |
+|      |       |NOTA� : El tamaño en bytes de este dato difiere del que      |
+|______|_______|podemos_encontrar_en_un_fichero_FPG._________________________|
+
+Puntos de control
+
+A continuación en el fichero se almacenan los puntos de control, tantos como
+indique el valor extraido del dato FLAGS. Es posible que esta sección no esté
+presente si ese valor es cero. En todo caso, cada punto de control es una
+estructura de 4 bytes que contiene:
+ ____________________________________________________________________________
+|Nombre|Tamaño_|Descripción__________________________________________________|
+|X_____|2_bytes|Coordenada_X_del_punto_de_control.___________________________|
+|Y_____|2_bytes|Coordenada_Y_del_punto_de_control.___________________________|
+
+Imaginemos que tenemos configurado solo el punto de control 54, por ejemplo.
+Aun así en el fichero se veran representados todos los puntos de control hasta
+ese. En este caso los puntos que no hemos configurado tendran un valor de -
+1 tanto en la coordenada X como en la Y.
+
+Ejemplo:
+
+      Solo hemos configurado el punto 4. Por lo tanto tendremos esto:
+            Punto 000 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 001 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 002 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 003 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 004 : X = 200; Y = 125
+
+      Ahora hemos configurado el punto 2 y el 4. Por lo tanto tendremos esto:
+            Punto 000 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 001 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 002 : X = 64; Y = 32
+            Punto 003 : X = -1; Y = -1
+            Punto 004 : X = 200; Y = 125
+
+Datos del gráfico
+
+Por último, aparecen los datos del gráfico propiamente dichos, de arriba a
+abajo: Tamaño en bytes de los datos = [ (ancho * alto) * (bpp / 8) ]
+En un gráfico de 8 bits el valor 0 (índice 0 de la paleta) está reservado
+para los pixels transparentes.
+
+En un gráfico de 16 bits, cada pixel se guarda en formato RGB565 con el valor
+0 reservado para los pixels transparentes (lo cual significa que el color negro
+puro no puede usarse, siendo necesario sustituirlo por un valor aproximado).

+		Librería con múltiples gráficos MAP e informacion de color de una paleta gráfica PAL.
+* Formatos de fichero de fuente
+	* BDF - Bitmap Distribution Format
+		Este tipo de letra de Adobe no incluye información de color: cada pixel puede ser transparente u opaco. Por defecto, los pixels opacos se dibujarán con el color blanco al utilizar esta fuente. Sin embargo, es posible escoger cualquier otro color empleando la función TEXT_COLOR
+		http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf
+	* FNT - Fuente
+		Un fichero FNT contiene un máximo de 256 mapas de bits, los cuales se corresponden con los 256 caracteres ASCII. El hecho de que sea una fuente de bitmap impide transformaciones como el escalado, rotado, etc., sin que esto suponga un deterioro en la caladidad gráfica. Es compatible con DIV.
+* Formatos de fichero de mapa
+	* FBM - Fenix Bitmap
+		Un fichero FBM contiene un gráfico sencillo, rectangular, opcionalmente animado, con transparencia por color key (cada pixel de la imagen puede contener un color, o bien ser totalmente transparente, pero no se soporta un color con transparencia parcial).
+	* MAP -Mapa
+		Un fichero MAP contiene un gráfico sencillo, rectangular, con transparencia por color key (cada pixel de la imagen puede contener un color, o bien ser totalmente transparente, pero no se soporta un color con transparencia parcial).
+	* PNG -Portable Network Graphics
+		Formato gráfico basado en un algoritmo de compresión sin pérdida para bitmaps no sujeto a patentes. Este formato fue desarrollado en buena parte para solventar las deficiencias del formato GIF y permite almacenar imágenes con una mayor profundidad de color y otros importantes datos. Al contrario que el formato GIF, PNG no soporta animaciones.
+		http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/iso/
+* Formatos de fichero de paleta
+	* FPL - Fenix Palette
+		Un fichero FPL contiene toda la informacion de color de una paleta gráfica. Actualmente solo se soportan paletas gráficas de 8 bits, pero es posible que en un futuro se añada soporte para paletas indexadas de mayor profundidad de color.
+	* PAL - Paleta
+		Un fichero PAL contiene toda la informacion de color de una paleta gráfica. Actualmente solo se soportan paletas gráficas de 8 bits. Ademas incluye información sobre gammas de color cuya utilidad era hacer mas facil el manejo de color en el editor de mapas de DIV y DIV2.
