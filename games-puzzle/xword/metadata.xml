 <longdescription>Reads and writes crossword puzzles in the Across Lite file
   format. Xword is a GTK+ program that works well for doing crossword puzzles
   in the Across Lite file format used by The New York Times and others. As
   well as a clock, it supports printing. It also auto-saves puzzles as you
   solve them so that you can return to partially completed
   puzzles.</longdescription>
