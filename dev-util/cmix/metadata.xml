<longdescription>A program specializer or, as it is also called, a "partial
evaluator" takes the source code for a program or a routine and (commonly) some
of its input, and tries to produce faster but equivalent code, utilizing the
fact that some of the variables will have known values so that some of the
program's actions can be precomputed.

This allows one to combine the maintainability of a generic parameterized source
code with the speed of programs optimized for specific problem instances.

C-Mix is a program specializer that works on portable C code. You will need a C
compiler for compiling intermediate programs.</longdescription>
