.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B a+
command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; install the package
aplus-fsf-doc then open /usr/share/doc/aplus-fsf-doc/html/index.html.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.SH AUTHOR
This manual page was written by Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>,
for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
