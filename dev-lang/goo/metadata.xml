 <longdescription>GOO is a dynamic, type-based, object-oriented language in the
   same family as Dylan and Scheme.  It is designed to be simple, productive,
   powerful, extensible, dynamic, efficient, and real-time.

   Its main goal is to offer the best of both scripting and delivery languages,
   while at the same time incorporating an extreme back-to-basics philosophy.
