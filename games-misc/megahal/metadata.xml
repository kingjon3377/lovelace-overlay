 <longdescription>Conversation simulator that can learn as you talk to it.
   Conversation simulators are computer programs which give the appearance of
   conversing with a user in natural language. Such programs are effective
   because they exploit the fact that human beings tend to read much more
   meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading
   structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as valid
   conversation.
   
  MegaHAL differs from conversation simulators such as Eliza in that it uses a
  Markov Model to learn how to hold a conversation. It is possible to teach
  MegaHAL to talk about new topics, and in different
  languages.</longdescription>
