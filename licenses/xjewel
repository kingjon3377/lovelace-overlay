This game was originally written by Yoshihiro Satoh of HP.  I have made a
modest attempt to replicate Domain/JewelBox under X.

I have somewhat rudely taken the bitmaps from the original game and
created this version.  I hold the copyright for the code, as I created
it, but I hold no claim to the bitmaps which were freely
distributed with the Domain version.

REDISTRIBUTION in source or binary from is permited as long as adequate
notation of the originators is retained, including the developer of the 
original Domain/Jewlbox, Yoshihiro Satoh.
NOTE: I do not claim to hold any copyright on columns games, Jewelbox, or any
related name or icon.  I have written the source and thats all I hold claim to.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PERIL, I MAKE NO CLAIM OF USEABILITY OR WARANTY.
