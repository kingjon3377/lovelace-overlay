This program was written for fun and is free.  Distribute it as you please,
but please distribute the entire package, with the original words721.txt and
the readme file.  If you modify the code, please mention my name in it as
the original author.  Please send me a copy of improvements you make, because
I may include them in a future version.

I may be contacted by email at criswell@itsc.uah.edu
