I have no problem with this. What I don't want is for some commercial game 
company to produce a version of my game and not pay me royalties for it. 
If it's part of a general collection of games, and it's OK by Andrew, then 
yes, 
his implementation can go on your distribution disc.

Yes, but the intention was that it be TOTALLY free. If people sell it for 
profit, then it's not totally free; if they charge for it to cover 
distribution costs, 
well, OK.
