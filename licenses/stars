		     NOTE ON STAR DATA FILES

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this copyright note, but changing it is not allowed.

The Makefile and .spec file of this data set are licensed under the GNU GPL,
of which you should have received a copy with the StarPlot documentation.
The GPL also applies to the text documentation (README, INSTALL) for this data
set, except where it would conflict with the licensing requirements described
below.  The GPL does ***NOT*** apply to the star data files enclosed or
generated.  The data files in the orig-data directory originate from the 
Astronomical Data Center (http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov) at NASA Goddard Space 
Flight Center, and are copyrighted by their respective authors.  Upon asking 
the ADC about the permissibility of their redistribution, I was told the
following:

	Yes, you are free to distribute the files with your program.
	Although, we do ask that you acknowledge, your source (the ADC)
	and the original authors.

	See: http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/acknowledge_adc.html
	for more information.

My conclusions are that (1) you are free to redistribute the ADC data files.
However, (2) you must not delete any documentation giving credit for the data
files, for example in the README; and (3) the data files must NOT be altered in
any way (without permission of the original authors).  Therefore (4) it is NOT
permissible to redistribute the *.stars files which the StarPlot conversion
program creates from the ADC data files.  I have confirmed these conclusions
with the ADC.
