 <longdescription>The Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling is a collection of
   software tools to present conceptual models of software systems in the form
   of diagrams, tables, trees, and the like. A conceptual model of a system is
   a structure used to represent the requirements or architecture of the
   system. TCM is meant to be used for specifying and maintaining requirements
   for desired systems, in which a number of techniques and heuristics for
   problem analysis, function refinement, behavior specification, and
   architecture specification are used.  TCM takes the form of a suite of
   graphical editors that can be used in these design tasks. These editors can
   be categorized into: 

   * Generic editors for generic diagrams, generic tables and generic trees.
   * Structured Analysis (SA) editors for entity-relationship diagrams, data
     and event flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, function refinement
     trees, transaction-use tables and function-entity type tables. 
   * Unified Modeling Language (UML) editors for static structure diagrams,
     use-case diagrams, activity diagrams, state charts, message sequence
     diagrams, collaboration diagrams, component diagrams and deployment
     diagrams (only the first three UML and last two editors are functional at
     this moment). 
   * Miscellaneous editors such as for JSD (process structure and network
     diagrams), recursive process graphs and transaction decomposition tables. 

   TCM supports constraint checking for single documents (e.g. name duplication
   and cycles in is-a relationships). TCM distinguishes built-in constraints
   (of which a violation cannot even be attempted) from immediate constraints
   (of which an attempted violation is immediately prevented) and soft
   constraints (against which the editor provides a warning when it checks the
   drawing). TCM is planned to support hierarchic graphs, so that it can handle
   for example hierarchic statecharts. Features to be added later include
   constraint checking across documents and executable models.
