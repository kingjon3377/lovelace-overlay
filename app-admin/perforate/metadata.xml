 <longdescription>GNU cp used to detect files that contain 0-filled holes and
   save disk space by skipping them with lseek when writing a file and thus not
   allocating disk blocks. Unfortunately it does no longer. So here is program
   to make holes in existing files.

   Also there are some scripts that help cleaning up the hard disk (finding
   duplicated and/or unstripped files).</longdescription>
