.SH NAME
slingshot \- simple 2D shooting strategy game set in space, with gravity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B slingshot
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B slingshot
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBslingshot\fP is a two dimensional, turn based simulation-strategy
game set in the gravity fields of several planets. It is a highly
addictive game, and never the same from round to round due to its
randomly generated playing fields.
.PP
It is a deceptively simple game, the goal is to shoot the other
spacecraft through the field of planets, but their gravity makes it
tricky. The effects of the gravity mean that although it's easy to
learn how to play, and to enjoy playing, it could take a lifetime to
thoroughly master.
.PP
In order to hit your opponent, you can rotate you ship to aim in any
direction, and you can change the power with which your projectile is
launched - the initial speed at which it flies. 
.SH OPTIONS
This program has no command line options.
