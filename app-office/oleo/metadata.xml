 <longdescription>Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more
   expensive spreadsheet).  It is an X client and also runs on character-based
   terminals.  It can generate embedded Postscript renditions of spreadsheets.
   Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable by
   users.</longdescription>
