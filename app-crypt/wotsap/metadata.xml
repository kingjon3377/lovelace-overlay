 <longdescription>Wotsap is a tool that analyzes a OpenPGP Web of Trust
   description and reports to the user stastistics about the single keys and
   the whole network, or searches for paths from one key to another.

   OpenPGP is the most widely used email encryption standard, used by
   encryption software such as the GNU Privacy Guard (gpg).  To encrypt to
   someone or verify someone's signature, you need that persons OpenPGP key.
   Say you want to verify a digital signature made by Bob. To get Bob's key is
   easy with some help from keyservers, being sure you got the right key is the
   tricky part. This is accomplished either by meeting Bob in person and
   exchanging signatures, or by trusting someone else, who you have met in
   person, who claims to have met Bob.  Or by trusting someone who has met
   someone who has met Bob. This gives rise to a completely decentralized
   network of trusts between people.

   Wotsap lets you explore the Web of Trust. It works on a compressed copy of
   the Web of Trust in the .wot file format, generated daily and distributed on
   the site of wotsap main writer.</longdescription>
