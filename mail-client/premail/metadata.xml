<longdescription>Premail adds support for encrypted e-mail to your mailer, using
plain PGP, PGP/MIME, MOSS, or S/MIME.  In addition, premail provides a seamless,
transparent interface to the anonymous remailers, including full support for
Mixmaster remailers and the nymservers.  Nymservers provide cryptographically
protected, fully anonymous accounts for both sending and receiving
e-mail.</longdescription>
