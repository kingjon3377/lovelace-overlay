The Debian Package MLS
----------------------

This is the MLS MailListStat program packaged for Debian
by Kevin M. Rosenberg <kmr@debian.org>, July 2002.

This package displays statistics on mailbox files that are in
the MBOX format.

Compared to the upstream version, this package has renamed
the binary and manpage files to "mailliststat" from the original "mls"
and has an improved l10n support.

The home for MLS is http://marki.host.sk/MLS.
