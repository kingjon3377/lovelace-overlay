<longdescription lang="en">The 'default' way to switch windows in Ratpoison is
	to press CTRL-T, w to get the window list, find the number of the window
	you want to switch to (let's say it's 2), and press CTRL-T, 2 to switch to
	that window.

	rpbar is a simple taskbar that gives a permanent display of the windows in
	the current group in order to make the first CTRL-T, w unnecesary. As a
	concession to The Rat, clicking on a window title will select that window.
	This is useful for one-handed window selection.

	The main inspiration is the simple task bars you get in other minimalistic
	window managers such as Awesome or wmii. rpbar's appearance is modeled on
	these task bars.</longdescription>
