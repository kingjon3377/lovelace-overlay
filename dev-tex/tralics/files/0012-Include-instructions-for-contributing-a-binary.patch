+The Softcover ebook production system is distributed via the Ruby gems `softcover` and `polytexnic`, the latter of which uses Tralics to convert LaTeX to XML (and [thence](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thence) to HTML). The `polytexnic` gem ships with precompiled Tralics binaries for OS X and select Linux distributions, so that `polytexnic` Just Works™ on most systems, but if your system is not among those supported natively you'll have to compile a version of Tralics for your system. This involves cloning the `tralics` repository, running `make`, and placing the resulting excutable on the path:
 
     $ git clone https://github.com/softcover/tralics
     $ cd tralics/src
     $ make
     $ cp tralics /usr/local/bin
 
-In place of `/usr/local/bin` in the last step, you can choose any directory on your path.

+## Contributing a binary
+
+Ideally, we would like the `polytexnic` gem to support as many systems as possible without separate compilation steps. If you needed to compile your own binary and would like to contribute it back to the project, please send an email to <michael@softcover.io> with the `tralics` binary attached and with the result of running the following command:
