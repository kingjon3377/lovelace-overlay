 <longdescription>StarPlot is a GTK+ based program that can be used
   interactively to view three-dimensional perspective charts of stars.  Charts
   can be re-centered, rotated, or zoomed in or out with a mouse click (this
   can also, of course, be done via dialog boxes for more precision).  Stars
   may be viewed (or ignored) by spectral class and absolute magnitude.

   StarPlot is packaged with starconvert, a utility that converts line-oriented
   stellar data records to StarPlot format.  Most star data files available on
   the Internet can be converted this way if a short file describing the
   original file format is provided to starconvert.</longdescription>
