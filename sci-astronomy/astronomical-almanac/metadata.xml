 <longdescription>The aa program computes the orbital positions of planetary
   bodies and performs rigorous coordinate reductions to apparent geocentric
   and topocentric place (local altitude and azimuth).  It also reduces star
   catalogue positions given in either the FK4 or FK5 system.  Data for the 57
   navigational stars is included.  Most of the algorithms employed are from
   The Astronomical Almanac (AA) published by the U.S. Government Printing
   Office.

   The aa program follows the rigorous algorithms for reduction of celestial
   coordinates exactly as laid out in current editions of the Astronomical
   Almanac.  The reduction to apparent geocentric place has been checked by a
   special version of the program (aa200) that takes planetary positions
   directly from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory DE200 numerical integration of
   the solar system. The results agree exactly with the Astronomical Almanac
   tables from 1987 onward (earlier Almanacs used slightly different reduction
   methods).

   Certain computations, such as the correction for nutation, are not given
   explicitly in the AA but are referenced there. In these cases the program
   performs the full computations that are used to construct the Almanac tables
   (references are provided).</longdescription>
