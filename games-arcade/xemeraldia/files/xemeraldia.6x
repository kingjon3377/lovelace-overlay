.SH NAME
xemeraldia \- not just another tetris clone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xemeraldia
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR xemeraldia
program.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
(but may be used by others), because the original program does not
have a manual page. Instead, as would be expected on a Debian system, it has
documentation in /usr/share/doc/xemeraldia.
.SH AUTHOR
This manual page was written by Joey Hess, for Debian.
